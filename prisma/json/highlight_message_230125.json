The law requires agencies to compile and make available projections of contracting opportunities small and small disadvantaged firms may be able to perform.</p>\r\n<p>In response to this requirement, the Department of State Forecast of Contract Opportunities includes projections of anticipated contract above the simplified acquisition threshold that small businesses, small disadvantaged businesses, women-owned small businesses, HUBZone small businesses, and service-disabled veteran-owned small businesses may be able to perform under direct contracts with the Government, or through subcontracting opportunities. This Department-wide forecast of contract opportunities expands upon individual efforts already implemented at Department of State aimed at enhancing competition in contracting. The forecast consolidates anticipated procurements at various State Department acquisition activities.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
